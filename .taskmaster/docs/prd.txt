# Overview  
Modular Lead Management Platform - A streamlined lead management dashboard designed for rapid MVP development and team collaboration. The platform provides essential lead management functionality through a clean, modern interface with comprehensive analytics and configurable workflows. Built with SvelteKit frontend and FastAPI backend, utilizing Neon PostgreSQL for seamless team development.

The platform addresses the critical need for businesses to effectively manage, analyze, and process leads through an intuitive dashboard interface. Instead of complex automation systems, it focuses on providing clear visibility into lead data, comprehensive analytics for decision-making, and structured workflows for lead processing. The system is designed for immediate usability while maintaining a foundation for future enhancements.

# Core Features  
1. **Lead Management Dashboard**: Central hub for viewing and managing all leads with real-time updates. Provides clean, intuitive interface for lead overview, status tracking, and quick actions. Essential for giving users immediate visibility into their lead pipeline and enabling efficient lead management workflows.

2. **Comprehensive Lead List**: Detailed lead listing page with advanced filtering, sorting, and search capabilities. Displays all relevant lead information including contact details, source attribution, status, scores, and interaction history. Critical for users to quickly find, review, and take action on specific leads.

3. **Advanced Analytics Page**: Rich analytics dashboard featuring comprehensive metrics visualization through charts and graphs. Includes conversion funnels, lead source performance, scoring distributions, temperature analytics, and trend analysis. Provides data-driven insights for optimizing lead management strategies and measuring performance.

4. **Structured Workflow System**: Organized workflow pages containing three primary workflows - Lead Generation, Lead Enrichment, and Lead Scoring. Each workflow provides clear processes, status tracking, and actionable steps. Foundation for systematizing lead management operations and ensuring consistent processing.

5. **Lead Generation Workflow**: Systematic process for capturing and importing leads from various sources. Includes lead validation, deduplication, and initial categorization. Ensures consistent lead intake and proper data quality from the start.

6. **Lead Enrichment Workflow**: Process for enhancing lead data with additional information including company details, social profiles, and demographic data. Improves lead quality and provides more context for sales activities.

7. **Lead Scoring Workflow**: Framework for evaluating and scoring leads based on multiple criteria including engagement, demographics, and behavioral indicators. Helps prioritize leads and focus efforts on highest-potential opportunities.
