      "expansionPrompt": "Break down each major component (scoring, enrichment, ML integration, API, behavioral tracking, source attribution, workflow customization) into focused subtasks, ensuring clear ownership and incremental delivery.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple complex subsystems (rule-based and ML scoring, enrichment pipelines, API design, behavioral tracking, source attribution, workflow customization), each requiring specialized expertise and integration. The high number of dependencies and technical breadth justifies a high complexity score and a detailed breakdown for manageability."
