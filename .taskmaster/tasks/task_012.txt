# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Tiered N8N Workflow Builder Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an Industry Package Manager as the primary feature, with a tiered N8N workflow builder interface as a secondary component.

   c. Implement marketplace-style interface for discovering and deploying packages
   d. Integrate package manager with tiered access control

2. Enhance the tiered N8N workflow builder interface:
   a. Basic tier: Access to pre-built industry packages and templates
   b. Standard tier: Limited customization of industry packages
   c. Advanced tier: Full customization of packages with guardrails
   d. Enterprise tier: Complete package creation and management capabilities

3. Implement access control system:
   a. Create user roles corresponding to each tier
   b. Develop middleware to enforce access restrictions based on user roles
   c. Implement API endpoints for tier-specific functionalities and package access

4. Develop sandbox environments for package testing:
   a. Create isolated testing environments for each tier
   b. Implement resource allocation and limitations for sandboxes
   c. Develop sandbox creation and management interface

5. Implement version control system for packages and workflows:
   a. Integrate Git-like versioning for packages and individual workflows
   b. Develop interface for viewing and managing package/workflow versions
   c. Implement diff viewer for comparing versions

6. Create rollback capabilities for packages and workflows:
   a. Develop system for storing package and workflow states
   b. Implement rollback functionality in the UI
   c. Create API endpoints for programmatic rollback

7. Implement resource limits and guardrails:
   a. Define resource usage metrics for packages and workflows
   b. Implement real-time monitoring of resource usage
   c. Create alerting system for approaching or exceeding limits
   d. Develop automatic suspension mechanism for exceeding limits

8. Integrate with existing N8N instance:
   a. Extend API endpoints to support package management and tiered access
   b. Modify existing workflow templates to fit into industry packages
   c. Implement new API endpoints for advanced features (sandboxing, versioning, rollback)

9. Develop user documentation:
   a. Create tier-specific user guides for package management
   b. Develop tooltips and in-app guidance for package-related features
   c. Create video tutorials for complex operations

10. Implement analytics and reporting:
    a. Track usage patterns across different tiers and packages
    b. Create dashboard for admins to monitor system and package usage
    c. Implement reporting functionality for user activities and resource consumption

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   a. Write unit tests for each component of the Industry Package Manager
   b. Test access control logic for each tier and package permissions
   c. Verify sandbox environment isolation for package testing
   d. Test version control operations for packages and workflows
   e. Validate rollback functionality for packages and workflows

2. Integration Testing:
   a. Test the integration of the Package Manager with the existing N8N instance
   b. Verify that API endpoints correctly handle tiered access and package management
   c. Test the interaction between sandbox environments and the main system
   d. Validate version control system integration with packages and N8N workflows

3. User Acceptance Testing:
   a. Create test scenarios for each tier (Basic, Standard, Advanced, Enterprise)
   b. Verify that users can only access and customize packages appropriate to their tier
   c. Test package installation, customization, and execution across all tiers
   d. Validate sandbox environment usage for package testing

4. Performance Testing:
   a. Conduct load testing to ensure system stability under high user concurrency
   b. Test resource limit enforcement for packages and system behavior under stress
   c. Measure and optimize response times for critical package management operations

5. Security Testing:
   a. Perform penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in package management
   b. Verify that users cannot escalate privileges or access higher-tier packages
   c. Test sandbox environment isolation to ensure no data leakage between users and packages

6. Usability Testing:
   a. Conduct user sessions to gather feedback on package management interface intuitiveness
   b. Test accessibility compliance across all tiers and package-related features
   c. Verify that documentation and in-app guidance for package management are helpful and accurate

7. Regression Testing:
   a. Ensure that the new package management system doesn't break existing N8N functionality
   b. Verify that all previously created workflows still function correctly within packages

8. Edge Case Testing:
   a. Test system behavior when switching between tiers and its effect on package access
   b. Verify proper handling of packages that exceed tier limitations
   c. Test version control and rollback with complex, long-running packages

9. Compatibility Testing:
   a. Test the package management interface across different browsers and devices
   b. Verify API compatibility with external tools and integrations for package management

10. Monitoring and Logging:
    a. Verify that all user actions related to package management are properly logged
    b. Test the analytics and reporting features for accuracy in package usage tracking
    c. Ensure that resource usage for packages is correctly tracked and reported
