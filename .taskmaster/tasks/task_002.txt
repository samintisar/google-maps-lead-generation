# Title: Design and Implement Neon PostgreSQL Database Schema
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Define and implement database schema for Lead, Analytics, Workflow, User, and Organization entities as per PRD.
# Details:
Design tables for Lead (contact_info, company_details, lead_source, lead_status, lead_score, lead_temperature, interaction_history, enrichment_data, creation_date, last_updated), Analytics (conversion_metrics, source_performance, scoring_distributions, temperature_analytics, trend_data, funnel_metrics), Workflow (workflow_type, workflow_steps, current_status, completion_percentage, assigned_leads, execution_history), User (basic_profile, role, permissions, dashboard_preferences), Organization (company_info, settings, lead_count, user_count, subscription_status). Use Neon PostgreSQL for cloud-based storage and team collaboration. Implement indexes for performance.

# Test Strategy:
Validate schema with sample data insertion and retrieval. Test foreign key constraints and query performance.
