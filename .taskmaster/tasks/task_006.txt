Lead scoring system implementation completed:
- Created LeadScoringService with rule-based scoring
- Implemented scoring categories: demographic, engagement, behavioral, source-based, temperature
- Added automatic temperature updates
- Built score tracking with audit trail
- Created detailed score breakdown
- Implemented org-specific rules support
- Added bulk operations
- Created comprehensive API endpoints

Scoring rules:
- Demographic: company +10, job title +8, phone +5, LinkedIn +5
- Engagement: email opens +2, clicks +5
- Behavioral: recent activity +10, interactions +8, inbound +12
- Source-based: referral +20, social +8, ads +12
- Temperature: hot +15, warm +8, cold 0

API endpoints: calculate, update, history, bulk-update, analytics

System logs all changes in ActivityLog with detailed breakdown.

## 2. Develop Enrichment Processes [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create processes for enriching raw data with additional context and information
### Details:
Implement data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation techniques; integrate external data sources for enrichment
<info added on 2025-06-04T21:36:19.483Z>
EXPLORATION PHASE 1 GOALS:
1. Examine existing codebase structure for lead scoring and enrichment.
2. Identify current data models and database schema.
3. Find existing enrichment-related code or APIs.
4. Determine integration points for external data sources.
5. Plan specific enrichment processes needed.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review backend code structure for lead management.
2. Check existing database schema for enrichment fields.
3. Identify external APIs/services for data enrichment.
4. Design enrichment pipeline architecture.

<info added on 2025-06-04T21:37:00.379Z>
EXPLORATION PHASE 1 COMPLETED:

Key Findings:
1. Lead scoring service located in backend/services/lead_scoring_service.py
2. Database schema includes Lead model with enrichment-ready fields: linkedin_url, company, job_title, website, custom_fields (JSON), tags (JSON)
3. Activity logging system implemented for enrichment action tracking
4. Integration model exists for external service connections
5. Current APIs: /api/leads, /api/workflows, /api/organizations

Enrichment Opportunities:
- Email validation and reputation checking
- LinkedIn profile data enrichment
- Company domain analysis and firmographics
- Phone number validation and formatting
- WHOIS data for website analysis
- Social media profile discovery
- Industry classification
- Lead deduplication and data normalization

Next Phase: Design and implement enrichment pipeline architecture

EXPLORATION PHASE 2 GOALS:
1. Design comprehensive lead enrichment pipeline architecture
2. Identify and integrate external data sources for enrichment
3. Create enrichment services and workflows
4. Implement data validation and quality checks

ENRICHMENT PLAN:
1. Email validation and verification
2. Company domain analysis and firmographics
3. LinkedIn profile enrichment
4. Phone number validation and formatting
5. Industry/technology classification

IMPLEMENTATION PHASE COMPLETED - EMAIL VALIDATION FOUNDATION:

Core Enrichment Service:
- Lead enrichment service implemented in backend/services/lead_enrichment_service.py
- Email validation using email-validator library (minor test domain issue)
- Phone number validation and formatting with international support
- Company name normalization and industry classification
- Data normalization for names, job titles, companies
- Duplicate detection across email, name, phone, and company fields
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

API Endpoints Implemented:
- /api/enrichment/leads/{lead_id}/enrich (Full enrichment)
- /api/enrichment/leads/{lead_id}/enrich-status (Status check)
- /api/enrichment/leads/{lead_id}/validate (Data validation only)
- /api/enrichment/bulk/enrich (Bulk enrichment)
- /api/enrichment/enrichment-types (Available types list)

Test Results:
- Phone validation, company enrichment, data normalization, duplicate detection, full pipeline, and data persistence working as expected
- Full pipeline processing time: 67ms

Issues and Next Steps:
- Investigate "local" error in email validation for test domain
- Consider adding external API integrations for enhanced company data
- Proceed to next phase: Enhanced external data source integration (WHOIS, social profiles, advanced company data)
