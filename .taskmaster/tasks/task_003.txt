# Task ID: 3
# Title: Design and Implement Database Schema
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the PostgreSQL database schema for core entities and implement data access layer
# Details:
1. Design schema for User, Lead, Organization, and Workflow entities
2. Implement SQL scripts for schema creation
3. Set up indexes for performance optimization
4. Implement data access layer using SQLAlchemy ORM
5. Set up Redis for caching and session management

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify schema integrity and relationships
2. Test data insertion, retrieval, and updates
3. Perform query performance analysis
4. Validate Redis caching effectiveness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Database Schema Design [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive database schema design for the project
### Details:
Analyze requirements, identify entities and relationships, create ER diagrams, and define table structures
<info added on 2025-06-02T10:33:44.720Z>
Initial database schema analysis completed. Existing models include User, Organization, Lead, WorkflowExecution, and ActivityLog, with PostgreSQL/SQLAlchemy setup. Identified gaps: Workflow entity for n8n templates, enhanced lead scoring model, communication tracking, campaign management, and integration points. Current schema provides strong foundation with multi-tenancy and audit trail. Next steps: Create comprehensive ER diagram and define additional entities to address identified gaps.

COMPLETED: Created comprehensive database schema design with detailed documentation. Deliverables:
1) database_schema_design.md - Complete schema with 8 new entities (Workflow, LeadScoringRule, Communication, Campaign, Integration, etc.)
2) database_er_diagram.md - Full ER diagram with Mermaid visualization.
Analysis identified enhancement opportunities while leveraging existing strong foundation. Schema design now includes all identified gaps: Workflow entity for n8n templates, enhanced lead scoring model, communication tracking, campaign management, and integration points. The new entities seamlessly integrate with existing models (User, Organization, Lead, WorkflowExecution, ActivityLog) to maintain multi-tenancy and audit trail capabilities. Schema is now comprehensive and ready for the implementation phase.

## 2. Schema Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement the designed database schema in the chosen database system
### Details:
Create tables, define constraints, and set up initial indexes based on the schema design
<info added on 2025-06-02T10:57:20.336Z>
SCHEMA IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS:
âœ… COMPLETED:
- Enhanced models.py with all 12+ entity models, relationships, constraints, and indexes
- Updated Alembic env.py for proper migration detection
- Created PostgreSQL enum types
- Generated comprehensive migration file

ðŸ”§ CURRENT ISSUE:
SQLAlchemy attempting to recreate existing enum types, causing DuplicateObject errors

ðŸ“‹ REMAINING:
- Fix enum handling in migration
- Apply final migration
- Verify complete schema
- Test with sample data

Note: Schema design is complete; current challenge is a migration execution issue.

âœ… SCHEMA IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:
Successfully implemented the complete database schema with all 12+ entities. Fixed enum type conflicts using manual SQL migration. All tables created: lead_scoring_rules, campaigns, integrations, workflows, campaign_leads, communications, lead_assignments, lead_notes, lead_score_history. Enhanced existing tables with new columns (linkedin_url, lead_temperature, expected_close_date, last_engagement_date for leads; subscription_tier, billing_email for organizations; timezone, preferences, avatar_url for users). Migration applied successfully using Alembic. Schema is ready for API implementation.

## 3. Data Population and Testing [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Populate the database with test data and perform initial testing
### Details:
Create test datasets, insert data into tables, and verify data integrity and relationships

## 4. Query Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Analyze and optimize database queries for improved performance
### Details:
Identify slow queries, create execution plans, and optimize through indexing and query rewriting

## 5. Schema Refinement and Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Refine the schema based on optimization results and create documentation
### Details:
Make necessary adjustments to the schema, update ER diagrams, and create comprehensive documentation
<info added on 2025-06-02T11:51:37.283Z>
Schema refinement and documentation completed successfully. Comprehensive optimized schema documentation created, covering:
- All optimization improvements
- Performance metrics
- Database views
- Indexing strategy
- Query patterns
- Production recommendations

Documentation is production-ready and includes version history. ER diagrams have been updated to reflect the final schema design.
