# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Development Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize project repository with SvelteKit (v2.19.0), FastAPI (v0.115.11), Neon PostgreSQL, Docker, and Docker Compose. Configure environment variables and basic CI/CD pipeline.
# Details:
Create a monorepo or separate repos for frontend (SvelteKit with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) and backend (FastAPI, Python 3.13.2). Set up Docker Compose for local development with Neon PostgreSQL (latest). Use Node.js 22.14.0 and npm 11.2.0 for SvelteKit. Configure environment variables for database connection and API endpoints. Add basic CI/CD workflow for linting and testing.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository structure, Docker Compose setup, and environment variable configuration. Test local development environment by running both frontend and backend services.
