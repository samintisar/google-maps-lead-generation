# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Core Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish the foundational infrastructure for the project, including Git, Docker, Docker Compose, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring tools. Transition from n8n to a Python-based automation backend.
# Details:
This task involves setting up the core infrastructure and transitioning from n8n to a Python-based automation system. Key steps include:

1. Remove n8n components (Completed)
2. Update backend/ for Python automation (Completed)
3. Maintain existing infrastructure (Completed)
4. Update documentation
5. Test complete system integration
6. Start remaining containers and verify full functionality

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all n8n components are removed without affecting other services (Completed)
2. Test the enhanced FastAPI backend for automation management (Completed)
3. Validate the Python automation engine's scheduling capabilities (Completed)
4. Ensure the automation script management system is functional (Completed)
5. Confirm PostgreSQL, Redis, and monitoring services are working correctly (Completed)
6. Test frontend connectivity to the new Python automation system
7. Perform integration tests to ensure all components work together seamlessly
8. Verify that all containers start successfully and the system functions as expected
