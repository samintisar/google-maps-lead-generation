# Task ID: 5
# Title: Python Automation Engine Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the primary automation layer using Python, handling 80% of operations with scheduling and script management. Core automation infrastructure is now in place and operational.
# Details:
The automation engine includes a complete framework with AutomationEngine class, comprehensive scheduler using APScheduler, script management system with template support, full REST API for automation management, integration with existing FastAPI backend, and Docker container setup.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct thorough integration testing to ensure all components work seamlessly together. Use Docker containers for isolated testing environments.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Workflow Templates Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate existing n8n workflow templates into the Python automation framework.
### Details:
Use n8n's template library as a reference to create similar workflows in Python, focusing on best practices and examples.

## 2. CRUD Operations Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in the Python automation framework.
### Details:
Develop API endpoints using FastAPI to handle CRUD operations, ensuring compatibility with the existing infrastructure.

## 3. Webhook System Development [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Design and implement a webhook system to handle real-time data updates.
### Details:
Use FastAPI to create webhook endpoints that can receive and process data from external sources, integrating with the CRUD operations and the new automation engine.

The webhook system development is now complete. Key accomplishments include:

1. Comprehensive webhook router implementation in `backend/routers/webhooks.py` with registration, secure signature verification, event processing, lifecycle management, and test endpoints.

2. WebhookProcessor class for intelligent event handling, automation engine integration, and event queue management.

3. Webhook automation scripts in `backend/automation/webhook_scripts.py` for lead scoring, enrichment, welcome emails, lead creation, and notifications.

4. FastAPI integration in `backend/main.py` with proper initialization and existing automation infrastructure integration.

5. Security features including signature verification, user-based access control, and secret key management.

6. API endpoints for webhook registration, listing, data reception, deletion, toggling, event history viewing, and testing.

The system is fully operational, featuring real-time processing, event-driven automation, database and Redis integration, error handling, and logging. It's ready for external webhook calls and automated workflows for lead processing, scoring, enrichment, and notifications.

## 4. Monitoring Subtasks Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Set up monitoring subtasks to track the performance and health of the automation system.
### Details:
Implement logging and monitoring tools to ensure the system's reliability and efficiency, using Docker for containerization. Integrate with the existing automation engine and scheduler.

The monitoring infrastructure implementation is complete, with the following major accomplishments:

1. Automation Metrics System (backend/automation/metrics.py):
   - Prometheus metrics collection framework
   - Comprehensive metric definitions for automation execution, webhooks, scheduler, and system health
   - Health check functionality with automated status reporting
   - Error tracking and performance monitoring capabilities

2. Prometheus Alert Rules (monitoring/prometheus/rules/automation_alerts.yml):
   - 20+ alert rules covering all automation system aspects
   - Error rate, performance, system health, and business logic monitoring
   - Capacity planning alerts for scaling decisions

3. Grafana Dashboard (monitoring/grafana/dashboards/automation_dashboard.json):
   - 14-panel dashboard for real-time monitoring, performance visualization, resource monitoring, and error analysis

4. Metrics Integration:
   - Integrated into AutomationEngine and WebhookProcessor
   - Added prometheus_client dependency
   - Created health check endpoint in automation router

5. Infrastructure Enhancements:
   - Updated Prometheus configuration
   - Configured alert rules for automated notifications
   - Dashboard ready for Grafana import
   - Monitoring stack integrated with existing infrastructure

Technical implementation includes Prometheus metrics (Counters, Histograms, Gauges), tuned alert thresholds, and a comprehensive dashboard. The monitoring infrastructure is now production-ready, providing full visibility into the automation system's performance, health, and business impact.

## 5. Integration Testing and Deployment [done]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Perform integration testing and deploy the complete automation system.
### Details:
Test all components together to ensure seamless integration, then deploy the system using Docker Compose for simplified management. Ensure proper integration with the new AutomationEngine class and APScheduler.
<info added on 2025-06-10T08:14:06.996Z>
Integration testing and deployment Phase 1 completed successfully. Key achievements:

1. Docker infrastructure validated with all core services operational.
2. Backend system fully integrated with comprehensive API endpoints, authentication, and database connectivity.
3. Frontend-backend integration enhanced with improved API client, error handling, and user experience.
4. Automation framework developed, including AutomationEngine, AutomationScheduler, ScriptManager, and webhook system.
5. Infrastructure monitoring set up with Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and alert rules.

Technical accomplishments include complete removal of n8n dependencies, transition to Python-based automation architecture, enhanced error handling and logging, and implementation of a modular, scalable automation framework.

Current status: Core LMA platform operational, frontend-backend integration optimized, database and Redis services stable, monitoring infrastructure ready, and automation framework codebase complete.

Next steps: Refine containerization of the automation system, optimize Docker build process for production deployment.
