### 2. JSON Field Optimization with GIN Indexes

Enhanced JSON search performance for flexible data storage:
- **`idx_leads_tags_gin`**: Lead tagging system optimization
- **`idx_leads_custom_fields_gin`**: Custom field search optimization
- **`idx_users_preferences_gin`**: User preferences search
- **`idx_organizations_settings_gin`**: Organization settings optimization
- **`idx_lead_scoring_criteria_gin`**: Lead scoring rule criteria
- **`idx_campaigns_target_criteria_gin`**: Campaign targeting optimization
- **`idx_communications_metadata_gin`**: Communication metadata search

### 3. Partial Indexes for Active Records

Optimized indexes that only include active/relevant records:
- **`idx_organizations_active_only`**: Only active organizations
- **`idx_users_verified_active`**: Only verified, active users
- **`idx_leads_assignable`**: Only leads available for assignment
- **`idx_lead_scoring_rules_active_priority`**: Only active scoring rules

### 4. Time-Series Optimization

Optimized for time-based queries and recent data access:
- **`idx_activity_logs_monthly`**: Recent activity logs (90 days)
- **`idx_lead_score_recent`**: Recent lead score changes (30 days)
- **`idx_communications_upcoming`**: Upcoming scheduled communications

### 5. Covering Indexes for Read-Heavy Queries

Indexes that include additional columns to avoid table lookups:
- **`idx_leads_dashboard_summary`**: Complete lead dashboard data
- **`idx_activity_logs_user_summary`**: User activity summary data
- **`idx_campaign_leads_summary`**: Campaign performance data

### 6. Data Integrity Constraints

Added business logic constraints for data quality:
- Lead score range validation (0-100)
- Positive values for lead value and campaign budgets
- Lead scoring rule points validation (-100 to +100)

## Performance Monitoring Views

Created three analytical views for ongoing performance monitoring:

### 1. Lead Performance Summary (`v_lead_performance_summary`)
- Lead metrics by organization, status, source, and temperature
- Communication activity correlation
- 90-day rolling window for relevance

### 2. User Activity Summary (`v_user_activity_summary`)
- User productivity metrics
- Activity counts and lead assignments
- Weekly activity tracking

### 3. Organization Health (`v_organization_health`)
- Organization-wide KPIs
- User engagement and lead conversion metrics
- Workflow adoption tracking

## Database Maintenance Optimizations

### Statistics and Vacuum
- Updated table statistics for better query planning
- Performed VACUUM ANALYZE on high-activity tables
- Established maintenance procedures for ongoing optimization

### Query Plan Analysis
Implemented automated query plan analysis for key business queries:
- Lead dashboard queries
- Communication history retrieval
- Lead assignment queue management

### Index Naming Convention
- `idx_<table>_<purpose>` for composite indexes
- `idx_<table>_<field>_gin` for JSON GIN indexes
- `idx_<table>_<condition>` for partial indexes

### Performance Testing Strategy
1. **Baseline Measurement**: Record pre-optimization performance
2. **Targeted Testing**: Test specific query patterns
3. **Business Logic Validation**: Ensure queries return expected results

## Best Practices for Developers

### Query Guidelines
1. Always filter by `organization_id` first for multi-tenant queries
2. Use status filters early in WHERE clauses
3. Leverage covering indexes for read-heavy operations
4. Use JSON operators efficiently with GIN indexes

### Schema Changes
1. Consider impact on existing indexes
2. Test performance impact before deployment
3. Update statistics after schema changes
4. Review and update optimization script as needed
