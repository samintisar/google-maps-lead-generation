# Overview  
Lead Management Automation Platform - A comprehensive, n8n-powered lead management ecosystem that handles the complete lead lifecycle from capture to conversion. The platform combines intelligent automation, lead enrichment, multi-channel outreach capabilities, advanced SaaS metrics tracking, and a visual workflow builder. It empowers users to create sophisticated automation without coding, targeting businesses that need to deploy lead management systems rapidly across industries (real estate, SaaS, consulting, etc.).

The platform addresses the critical problem of manual, inefficient lead management processes that result in lost opportunities, inconsistent follow-up, and poor lead quality assessment. It provides value through automation of 80% of operations via visual n8n workflows while Python/FastAPI handles complex analytics and SaaS metrics calculations.

# Core Features  
1. **Automated Lead Enrichment**: Extract domains, validate emails, perform WHOIS lookups, scrape website metadata, use AI for industry classification and lead quality assessment, match social profiles, and enrich geographic data. Critical for improving lead quality and providing sales teams with actionable intelligence.

2. **Lead Scoring & Prioritization**: Implement scoring rules based on data completeness, behavioral tracking, source attribution, and time-decay algorithms. Uses ML-based predictive scoring for conversion probability. Essential for sales teams to focus on highest-value opportunities and optimize resource allocation.

3. **Multi-Channel Outreach Automation**: Email automation with SMTP integration, template management, drip campaigns, A/B testing, and tracking. Includes follow-up sequences with time/behavior-based triggers and multi-channel integration (Slack, SMS, CRM updates). Vital for maintaining consistent communication and nurturing leads through the funnel.

4. **SaaS Metrics Dashboard**: Calculate and visualize MRR/ARR, churn rates, CAC, LTV, conversion funnels, cohort analysis, and channel performance. Provides predictive analytics and attribution modeling. Critical for data-driven decision making and business growth optimization.

5. **Integrations & Extensibility**: Native integrations with CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive), communication tools (Gmail, Slack, Teams), marketing tools (Google Ads, Facebook Ads), and data sources (Google Sheets, Airtable). Essential for seamless workflow integration with existing business tools.

6. **User & Team Management**: Role-based access control, lead assignment rules, performance dashboards, quota management, and multi-tenant architecture. Important for scaling teams and maintaining organized lead distribution and accountability.

7. **Workflow Automation Builder**: Visual drag-and-drop n8n interface for creating custom workflows, template library, conditional logic, real-time testing, and version control. Core to the platform's no-code/low-code vision and user empowerment.

- **Organization Entity**: tenant_isolation, billing_info, custom_settings, integration_configs

**APIs and Integrations:**
- **CRM APIs**: HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive for bidirectional data sync
- **Communication APIs**: Gmail, Outlook, Slack, Twilio for outreach and notifications
- **Enrichment APIs**: WHOIS, social media, geographic data, AI classification services
