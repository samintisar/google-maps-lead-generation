# How to Actually Test the Lead Scoring Workflow in N8N Cloud

You're right - my previous testing was just **simulation**! Let's actually execute the workflow in your n8n Cloud instance.

## üöÄ Step 1: Import the Workflow

1. **Go to your n8n Cloud instance**
2. **Click "Import workflow"** (+ button > Import from file)
3. **Upload** the `n8n-workflows/Lead_Scoring.json` file
4. **Save** the imported workflow

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Configure the Workflow

### Update the HTTP Request Node
The workflow is already configured with the correct endpoint:
```
URL: http://192.168.1.106:8000/api/leads/dev?test_scoring=true
Method: GET
Authentication: None (for development)
```

### Check Email Configuration (Optional)
If you want to test email alerts:
- Configure SMTP credentials in the "Send Sales Alert Email" node
- Or disable this node for initial testing

## üß™ Step 3: Test the Workflow Manually

### Option A: Test Individual Nodes
1. **Select the "Get Leads for Scoring" node**
2. **Click "Test step"** or "Execute node"
3. **Verify** it returns the 4 test leads
4. **Continue testing** each subsequent node

### Option B: Execute Full Workflow
1. **Click "Execute workflow"** button
2. **Watch the execution** flow through each node
3. **Check for errors** in any node
4. **View the final results**

## üîç Step 4: Verify Execution Results

After execution, you should see:

### ‚úÖ Expected Success Flow
```
Hourly Score Update (Cron) 
    ‚Üì
Get Leads for Scoring (HTTP Request)
    ‚Üì (4 leads retrieved)
Calculate Lead Scores (Code)
    ‚Üì (Scores calculated)
Significant Score Change (If)
    ‚Üì (Some leads qualify)
Update Lead Score (HTTP Request) ‚ö†Ô∏è May fail - endpoint needs implementation
    ‚Üì
Is Hot Lead / Is Warm Lead (If conditions)
    ‚Üì
Notify Sales Team / Trigger Follow-up ‚ö†Ô∏è May fail - endpoints need implementation
    ‚Üì
Log Scoring Activity ‚ö†Ô∏è May fail - endpoint needs implementation
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Failures (These are OK!)
- **Update Lead Score**: `/api/leads/score/bulk-update-n8n` endpoint not implemented yet
- **Notify Sales Team**: `/api/sales-alerts/hot-lead` endpoint not implemented yet  
- **Log Scoring Activity**: `/api/leads/activity/log` endpoint not implemented yet

## üìä Step 5: What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
1. **"Get Leads for Scoring"** returns 4 leads in JSON format
2. **"Calculate Lead Scores"** processes all 4 leads and adds scoring data
3. **Score calculations** show realistic values (demographic, behavioral, etc.)
4. **Temperature classification** correctly identifies hot/warm/cold leads

### ‚ùå Expected Errors (Normal for now)
- HTTP 404/500 errors on bulk-update, sales-alerts, activity-log endpoints
- These will be fixed when we implement the missing backend endpoints

## üß™ Step 6: Manual Test Run

Let's do a quick test to verify your workflow is working:

1. **Import the workflow** into n8n Cloud
2. **Execute the "Get Leads for Scoring" node** manually
3. **Check if you get this result**:
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "email": "john.doe@example.com", 
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "company": "Tech Corp",
      "score": 75,
      // ... more fields
    }
    // ... 3 more leads
  ]
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If "Get Leads for Scoring" Fails:
- **Check URL**: Make sure `http://192.168.1.106:8000` is accessible from n8n Cloud
- **Try the URL in browser**: Visit the endpoint directly to verify it works
- **Check firewall**: Ensure your local backend is accessible from the internet

### If Scoring Calculation Fails:
- **Check the Code node**: Look for JavaScript errors in the console
- **Verify data structure**: Ensure the input data matches expected format

### If Everything Fails:
- **Use webhook testing**: Import the workflow and trigger via webhook
- **Test locally first**: Run n8n locally to test before using Cloud

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Your workflow is working correctly if:**
1. ‚úÖ "Get Leads for Scoring" retrieves 4 leads
2. ‚úÖ "Calculate Lead Scores" processes them without errors  
3. ‚úÖ Score breakdown shows realistic values
4. ‚úÖ Temperature classification works (hot/warm/cold)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Downstream endpoints fail (expected until we implement them)

## üìû Need Help?

If you're still not seeing executions in n8n Cloud:
1. **Check the executions tab** in your n8n Cloud workspace
2. **Look for error messages** in failed nodes
3. **Verify network connectivity** between n8n Cloud and your backend
4. **Test the backend endpoint** directly in a browser first

**The core workflow logic should work perfectly - any failures will be on the backend endpoints we haven't implemented yet!**
